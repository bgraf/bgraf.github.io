<main>
<p>In 2011â€“2017 I used Python regularly but not daily to drive small tasks and orchestration of larger programs.
Moving around files, creating directories, extracting data from HTML pages and so on.
In my case regular use was spread out wide enough that I always needed to lookup the docs again.
Thus Python seemed a bit like a necessary evil, I did not like working with it, but alternatives like bash or perl were even worse.</p>
<p>In constrast, working with statically strongly typed languages like OCaml or rust feels robust and safe.
If a function takes an integer it will be an integer no matter what.
Types can be used to search throughout a code base and lookup the corresponding code, no inspection during runtime required.
The tooling was(!) better too: auto-completion, refactoring, auto-generated documentation and simpler code discovery with go-to-declaration.</p>
<p>Now that python has <em>type hints</em> and allows for <em>gradual typing</em> the joy of using it is back.
It may not feel as robust as rust or OCaml code, but I feel like 90 % of the benefits working with a statically typed language are there.
This is not an original idea, I read it on reddit or someplace else before:
(for some people, including me) the benefits of statically typed languages do not derive from their static types being checked, but
from the tools enabled by types and their improvement of the user experience during programming.</p>
<p>Next follow the ways I utilize type hints working with VS Code and a Python plugin.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Discovering and Reading Code: Auto-Completion</strong></p>
<p>On typed objects, whether from the standard library, some third-party library or my own code, auto completion of
properties and methods works.
That makes it easier to discover the code and traverse the object hierarchy when I enter some method
and need to fix or extend something.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Refactoring</strong></p>
<p>Moving around modules; renaming classes, functions, parameters.</p>
