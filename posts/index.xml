      <description>Most MIP solver software packages support the concept of callbacks to interact with the solver during the solution process. Callbacks can be used to track the process, terminate early, generate user cuts to tighten the bounds on relaxed problems, take branching decisions and in case of the lazy constraint callback generate constraints on the fly.&#xA;Generating constraints during the solution process makes sense when&#xA;the number of constraints is relatively large (e.</description>

      <description>2024-09-22: The setup described below is outdated.&#xA;The spaced-repetition software Anki is supported by a centralized service allowing users to synchronize their flashcards between different devices and apps (desktops, mobile phones, etc.). The default service is called Ankiweb and free to use, but lacks encryption and should be used with care when cards contain confidential data. In this article I describe how to setup your personal synchronization server and show why it&amp;rsquo;s more complex than it would need to be.</description>
