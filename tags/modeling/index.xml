      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this post I&amp;rsquo;ll model a simple distributed system twice: informally in Python tested by unit testing&#xA;and formally in TLA+ verified by model checking.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Imagine a decade old system comprised of multiple independent subsystems like an ERP-system and some external services.&#xA;The system has been grown over a long time with changes now and then, but without a single person or team responsible to&#xA;keep a consistent vision. Also, the system is prone to various kinds of concurrency problems because considering&#xA;all of these special cases had been out of scope during development or had been simply overlooked.&#xA;These issues surface rarely enough to not create any immediate incentive to fix them.&#xA;In case an issue comes up, they are mitigated by human intervention.&#xA;Our job is to add new features to this system. In the best case also removing existing issues or&#xA;at least not adding any new ones.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
